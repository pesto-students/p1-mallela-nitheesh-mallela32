                                           How Web Works


   The web mainly works between two members  one is clients(Who sends the request) and servers(Who sends the response). 

In the above process there are many steps invloved there are :

1.An internet connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the web.

2.TCP/IP: how data should travel across the internet

 3.DNS: For example in www.google.com ,google is the domain name which contains the ip adresses uniquely to send the right information to the right server.


4.HTTP: it is a protocol or language that is used to exchange information between server and client.

5.Component files: the serves sends the files we asked for in the form of html,css,js,imgs,documents.


           If we have correct rights then server sends us the files we requested for and our browser does the remaining work.



   As the response comes the browser builds the  DOM tree and applies the styles from the parsing  and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it.
