2. there are 2 school beside that intersection so we need to provide a sepetate line for a bicycle .

3. so we need to provide a busstop at 100m from the intersection on all four sides.

4. we need to provide a foot-over bridge at 50m on all four sides.

5. we sholud provide an emergency lane for the ambulance .

6. we need to acquire an footpath for the pedistrains.
